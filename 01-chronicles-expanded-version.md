Chapter 1: Arrival

In February of 2020, an alien spaceship crashes in the mid-west of the United States, close to a farm house. The driver of the spaceship is a solo alien who is badly wounded. He manages to enter the farm house and implant a fetus inside a sleeping young woman through some kind of robotic technique.

The alien also broadcasts a message using shortwave radio, stating that a boy will be born who will carry human's hope to defend the dying sun. The shortwave radio transmission is picked up by a small number of people around the world.

Soon after, another spaceship arrives and takes the wounded alien away through a transporting light beam. The young woman is left confused and scared, not knowing what has just happened to her.

Chapter 2: The Birth

Nine months later, the young woman gives birth to a healthy baby boy. The birth is difficult, and the doctors are surprised to find that the baby has an unusual genetic makeup. The boy's father is unknown, and the mother is hesitant to share the details of the alien encounter with anyone.

As the boy grows up, he starts to exhibit unusual abilities, such as enhanced strength and speed, and an ability to communicate with animals. He is also extremely intelligent, and seems to have a deep understanding of science and technology that goes beyond his years.

Chapter 3: The Experiment

Meanwhile, the alien race that created the wormhole and sent the antimatter to the sun is conducting a dangerous experiment. They have created a machine that can harness the power of a dying star and use it to create a new universe.

The machine is unstable, and the aliens fear that it could destroy their own universe if it is not properly controlled. They believe that the boy born on Earth could be the key to stabilizing the machine and saving their universe.

Chapter 4: The Training

The aliens make contact with the boy and reveal their plan to him. They offer to train him in the use of their technology and abilities, and to prepare him for the task of stabilizing the machine.

The boy is torn between his loyalty to Earth and his desire to help the aliens. He knows that the survival of their universe is at stake, but he also knows that he has a duty to protect the dying sun of his own world.

Chapter 5: The Mission

In the end, the boy decides to accept the alien's offer and travel to their universe to help them stabilize the machine. He is accompanied by a team of human scientists and engineers, who are eager to study the alien technology and learn from the advanced civilization.

The journey is long and dangerous, but the boy is determined to succeed. He uses his enhanced abilities to navigate the treacherous landscape of the alien universe, and to communicate with the alien beings who inhabit it.

Finally, the boy reaches the machine, and he is able to stabilize it just in time. The alien universe is saved, and the boy returns to Earth a hero.

Chapter 6: The Future

Back on Earth, the boy is hailed as a savior. He is celebrated by people all around the world, and he becomes a symbol of hope for a dying planet.

But the boy knows that his work is not done. He continues to study science and technology, and he works tirelessly to find a solution to the dying sun problem. With the help of the alien technology, he discovers a way to reignite the sun's nuclear reaction, and to bring life back to a dying world.

The boy grows up to become a great scientist and leader, and he inspires generations of people to work together to protect their planet and explore the mysteries of the universe.


As tensions rise between the United Nations and the small country with valuable resources, the alien boy inside the woman's womb grows rapidly, showing incredible abilities beyond human comprehension. The woman, named Sarah, soon realizes that her unborn child is no ordinary human and that he possesses supernatural abilities that will be crucial for saving humanity from the impending doom.

As the United Nations army prepares to attack the small country, Sarah goes into labor and gives birth to the alien-human hybrid boy, whom she names Alex. The aliens who had contacted Earth earlier had made it clear that Alex was the key to humanity's survival, and they had implanted him in Sarah's womb to ensure his survival.

Despite Sarah's reluctance to part with her child, the aliens return to take Alex away, claiming that they need to train him for his mission. Sarah is left devastated and alone, with only the hope that her son will one day return to save humanity.

Meanwhile, the situation with the rebellious country escalates, and the United Nations army launches a full-scale attack. The rebels put up a fierce fight, but they are ultimately no match for the advanced weaponry of the western army. The small country is left devastated, and the valuable resources are seized by the United Nations.

The construction of the spaceships continues, and cryogenic freezing technology is perfected. In early 2023, the first group of humans is cryogenically frozen and sent off into space towards the nearest target planet. However, the mission is not without complications, as some of the cryogenic pods malfunction, resulting in the death of several passengers.

As the years go by, humanity faces various challenges, including technical failures, food shortages, and interpersonal conflicts. But they persevere, driven by the hope that they will one day find a new home and continue the human race.

In 2028, the sun begins to show signs of imminent death, and the remaining humans on earth start to evacuate to the spaceships. Alex, now a young adult, appears on earth with his advanced knowledge and abilities to help with the evacuation efforts. Together with the remaining humans, he boards the spaceships, and they set off into the depths of space, leaving behind a dying earth.

As they journey through space, Alex becomes the leader of the human race, and he uses his advanced knowledge to steer the ships towards their destination. They encounter several challenges along the way, including alien attacks and technical difficulties, but they ultimately reach the first target planet in 2040, where they begin to build a new home for the human race.

In the end, humanity survives, thanks to the efforts of a lone alien and the extraordinary abilities of his hybrid son. The future is uncertain, but the human spirit endures, and the hope for a better tomorrow lives on.

Chapter 9: Battle for Resources

The war between USE and PRNS continued to rage on throughout the fall of 2021. Despite the technological advantages of USE, the small country was not going down without a fight. With the secret support of Sentre, PRNS was able to hold its own against the USE forces, which were spread thin across the globe. The battle for control of the precious metal resources dragged on, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage.

Chapter 10: The Rise of the United States of Earth

As the war continued, USE realized that it needed to streamline its decision-making process and increase efficiency in order to build the necessary spaceships and technologies to save humanity from the dying sun. In October 2021, USE was born, with a focus on space exploration and technology development. The AI machine, developed by Goaga's AI group, was put in charge of fact-checking and calculating a score for proposals, making decision-making more efficient.

Chapter 11: The Church of New Sun

Meanwhile, a new threat emerged in the form of the Church of New Sun (CNS). This mysterious organization claimed to have the power to revive the sun and called for people to join them. They stole money from banks and other financial institutions to fund their own spaceship to fly close to the sun and cast some kind of magic. USE was quick to condemn CNS, claiming that they were attempting to destroy the sun and plunge humanity into darkness.

Chapter 12: The People's Republic of New Sun

It was discovered that members of CNS were hiding in the small country protected by Sentre, which had now renamed itself the People's Republic of New Sun (PRNS). The country was organized in a strict religious manner determined by CNS and had already made several failed attempts to launch spaceships towards the sun. USE accused PRNS of attempting to destroy the sun, which would be a mutually assured destruction similar to the Cold War era nuclear warheads.

Chapter 13: Invasion of PRNS

With the threat of CNS looming, USE decided to strengthen its efforts to invade PRNS. The battle for resources had become a battle for survival, and USE was determined to come out on top. However, with the secret support of Sentre and the fanaticism of CNS, PRNS was not going down without a fight. The stage was set for an epic battle that would decide the fate of humanity.
