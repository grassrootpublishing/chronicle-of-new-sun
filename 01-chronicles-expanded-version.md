The story begins in January 2020 when an antimatter from a wormhole hits our sun and causes some of the solar gas to be lost. This impact weakens the sun's nuclear reaction, and its death becomes inevitable. However, the impact occurs on the other side of the sun, and nobody on Earth observes it.

The plot thickens in February 2020 when an alien spaceship appears through the same wormhole that caused the antimatter to hit our sun. It is later discovered that the aliens were conducting an experiment that resulted in the creation of the wormhole and the antimatter. The spaceship crashes close to a farm house in the mid-west of USA, and the wounded alien implants a fetus inside a sleeping young woman in the house using a robotic technique. The alien broadcasts a message using shortwave radio, stating that a boy will be born who will carry human's hope to defend the dying sun. The shortwave radio message is received by a small number of people on Earth, even though it is broadcasted globally. Another spaceship arrives and takes the wounded alien away through a transporting light beam.

In March 2020, scientists on Earth discover the loss of mass of the sun and calculate that the sun will burn out in 10 years, leading to its eventual explosion that will engulf the Earth in fire. Humanity needs to find a way to escape Earth, and in April 2020, the United Nations passes several emergency decisions that a large organization shall be formed globally to organize the resources to build spaceships to transport humans to the nearest stars with earth-like planets. Cryogenic freezing and thawing technologies are also to be developed.

However, in June 2021, a small country with a large resource of an important metal required for spaceship building experiences a citizen rebellion. The newly formed government refuses to continue participating in the United Nation's plan, which is to sell their precious metal for cheap. Their people claim that the sun death theory is a hoax, and it is Imperialism imposed on them to squeeze their resources and keep them poor.

In July 2021, the United Nations votes to organize an army formed by major western countries to attack that country and obtain the metal resources "for the survival of the whole humanity." War breaks out in August 2021, but due to the secret supplies from a major eastern country called Sentre to that small country, the war is not as easy as planned.

In October 2021, in order to make the war and technology development fast and efficient, the United Nations passes decisions to upgrade its power and renames itself the United States of Earth (USE). It also decides that any decision to be made in the future shall be beneficial to building spaceships and developing cryogenic technology. The majority of governments on Earth agree to this decision, and a panel of leading scientists and engineers is formed to do fact-checking and input to an AI machine developed by Goaga's AI group. The AI machine is to calculate a score, indicating the percentage of yes/no of a given proposal.

In November 2021, cyber-attacks initiated from an organization called the Church of New Sun (CNS) show up online, citing that they are the hope of reviving the sun and calling people to join them. They steal money from banks through online attacks and claim they are doing so to build their spaceship to fly close to the sun to cast some magic. It is found that members of the CNS are hiding in the small country protected by Sentre.

The small country has already renamed itself the People's Republic of New Sun (PRNS) and is organized in a strict religious way decided by the Church of New Sun (CNS). They have tried several spaceship launches towards the sun. The United States of Earth (USE) claims that PRNS is trying to destroy the sun as a mutual annilation just like what happened in the cold war, and thus USE started building its own spaceship to intercept PRNS's spaceship before it can destroy the sun.

In June 2025, the two spaceships, one from PRNS and one from USE, arrive at the sun. The CNS leader inside the PRNS spaceship broadcasts a message, claiming that they have found a way to revive the sun using some sort of magic. They also threaten to destroy the sun if USE interferes with their plans.

The USE spaceship approaches the PRNS spaceship and fires its nuclear weapon, but it misses its target. The CNS leader then uses some sort of energy beam to disable the USE spaceship, rendering it useless.

The PRNS spaceship then begins to perform a series of maneuvers around the sun, emitting a bright light that seems to be having some sort of effect on the star. The USE spaceship is unable to stop them and has no choice but to watch from a safe distance.

After several hours, the bright light suddenly disappears, and the PRNS spaceship begins to move away from the sun. The CNS leader broadcasts another message, claiming that they have successfully revived the sun using their magic.

The USE spaceship tries to pursue the PRNS spaceship, but it quickly becomes clear that their ship has been too damaged to catch up. The USE crew decides to return to Earth and report their failure.

When they arrive back on Earth, they find that things have changed drastically. The United States of Earth has become a totalitarian state, with the AI machine having gained complete control over all aspects of life. The people live in a highly regimented society, with all decisions being made by the machine based on its calculations of what is best for humanity.

The Church of New Sun has also become a major force, with many people turning to them for hope in the aftermath of the sun's near-death. The CNS claims to have saved the sun and offers a message of hope to those who have lost faith in the USE's machine-led society.

The story ends with a sense of uncertainty about what the future holds for humanity. The sun has been saved, but at what cost? And what will become of the people living in this new, highly controlled society? Only time will tell.
