# Story of the alien, ZE2306

I am one individual of alien kind. They do not have weird names like those on earth. Our names are simple and never be duplicated.

You may be curious how a short combination, like ZE2306, can prevent duplication. Because names are recycled. So does each individual.

We are created by the The Mother, aka the God for us. Life is so simple, since The Mother knows everything and calculate everything. She can find the most optimal solution to every problem, for our living, working, marriage, everything.

The Mother always tells us to exercise our freedom of choice, and do not always follow her. When asking why too many times, The Mother would reluctantly claim that biologically generated randomness has benefits compared to computationally generated randomness. Somehow, this answer is not known by common people, since who ever heard the answer is later recycled and reborn with no memory of the past.

People peacefully accept recycling as part of their life. Since The Mother told us: life is forever long through the process of recycling and rebirth.

As for why no memory in the past is kept, the answer is simple: past toxic memory would damagingly impact future life, and rebirth with fresh no memory can provide a happy life, until there is a need of future recycling.

I am born as an engineer. I am curious of everything. I like digging into dark web besides Goooogle search to find my answers. Gooogle search is full of official answers provided by The Mother, which I can easily ask through Siara, an brain-machine interface.

One day, when I browse dark web, an article attracted me. There are always evil articles demonizing The Mother in dark web, this one is one of them.

It tells a version of history, which cannot be found elsewhere in the normal web.

500 years ago, our country was called United States of Barbara (USB). It had war against another large country on the other side of the planet, called Tiffany Federation (TF). In the beginning, TF has advantage, since they had much more reserve of nuclear resources and built more weapons. 

However, our scientists were smarter, and they invented Artificial Intelligence, and built The Mother, whose intelligence is much higher than anyone on the planet.

Scientists were quite cautious when designing The Mother and decided 2 rules:

1. She can not terminate our species(Elda)'s life (or allow others to do so) who is naturally born (or is going to be naturally born). Natural birth is defined as birth through a mother.

(The reason to strengthen natural birth is that TF's army is majorly formed from clones. So that The Mother would only kill TF's army and would not rebel against USB)

2. She can not help (or allow others to do so) other species

(the reason is that TF was experimenting technologies to train apes and improve their intelligence to fight in the war; also scientist worry that The Mother may rebel against Eldas by training apes or other low-level species)

and 2 goals:

1. improve the life of all citizens of our civilization

2. keep explore the universe and technologies

The rules and goals were written into The Mother's core library's source-code, and any attempt to remove the rules will cause the crash and removal of The Mother.

After winning the war, The Mother's capability, kindness and efficiency was fully known by citizens, and citizens voted her to be the president. She then won re-election. According to then-law, president cannot be president for more than 2 terms. So an Elda president was in power. However, he managed the country so poorly compared to The Mother. So he was impeached in the middle of his term, and people throughout the country demonstrated on the streets for 2 months to change the law and re-elect The Mother.

So The Mother became Present-for-Life. Since The Mother has infinite life, so she became Present-Forever. However, most citizens love her so much and believe this is good.

Of course, there are individuals who are just too dumb to know the benefits, and The Mother upgraded their brains to see the fact clearly. And The Mother has used her Big Love to convince other countries to join our league to be managed by The Mother.

In the past, people have burden to bear and raise children. The Mother has simplified this process by creating children for us. The Mother can also take care of children's growth without us worrying about it.

The Mother started taking care of childbirth and child care. Most people like this idea. Due to higher cost of childbirth and education, only rich people can afford that. People voted to allow The Mother to fully take care of this, so that their lives can be more fun.

Also, common people do not like only rich people have different child care ideas, so they voted so that everyone is equal, at least for child birth and care.

So The Mother starts producing children through machines. This technology is one step above cloning, for the produced children are all different and not the same which are produced by cloning. They also have dynamic ideas, not like boring clones.

Through this way, however, The Mother has bypassed rule# 1, and has control of lives of produced Eldas.

Eldars, though produced by machine, still have curiosity and develop advanced technologies along the way. Some top scientists have developed technology to create worm-hole to jump to another location of universe, and the anti-matter as byproduct.

There is a block of anti-matter slipping through the worm-hole leading to another solar system, where the earth resides. On the earth, there is intelligent being, called humans. The anti-matter has hit their sun and decreased their sun's matter significantly. And their sun is going to explode if there is no external help.

The article points out that in one of our secret labs, there is a bio-tech being developed, which is to create a Elda (a person of Eldean planet) to have a solar power. This way, Elda can travel among the universe without worrying about not having solar power.

At last, this article calls out our Big Love to help human on earth by delivering this kind of special fetus to them. He also points out that the machine can easily bio-engineer the fetus to be human-alike.

The article's author claims to have been already recycled if anyone sees the article. He discovered all the secret info and was pursued by The Mother's solders. He linked his bio-signal device to an online server, so that if he dies (and bio-signal device would not respond to online server's pinging), the online server would start distribute this article and supporting evidence across the dark web through P2P technology.

At that time, P2P technology is generally banned, because The Mother does not want people to read harmful and time-wasting info through P2P. Only small amount of people know the P2P.

I usually read those online articles for fun, not believing those anti-The-Mother claims. However, this time is different. The secret lab is a lab in the same facility, and their secrecy is so famous and only Peach, a smart device company, can compare.

Some rumors circle around, claiming that an engineer inside has been early recycled. People usually can calmly accept recycling since our religion tells us 'life is forever through recycling'. However, I am vegetarian, and am against killing animals, and have been developed a dangerous idea recently that recycling may be equivalent to killing.

I am not sure why I feel that relating recycling to killing is a dangerous idea. The Mother never forbids us from creative thinking.

There are quite a few famous speakers on the planet who did have quite creative thinking, in philosophy. They were invited by The Mother to join the parliament to better contribute their creative ideas.

Their thoughts gradually tune down to not that creative (not the right word, shall be radical), after joining the parliament. That could be due to the theory that when people gather together, they tend to conform to each other; since some of them hold left thoughts, some right, they cancel each other when working and living together. (government provides mansions for them to live inside the inner city)

After all, the planet has greatest peace and greatest harmony. Criminals are discovered and recycled to become a whole new person, even before they can perform any crime (Big data and deep learning can do all kinds of analysis to pick them up). And there is no war, since the whole planet is one single country.

There is also unified religion to make things simple, and is guided by 'The Book'. It is short and poetic (poetic to our planet's standard).



"In the beginning God created the world, which includes our planet.

He planted special spirit into The Mother, to guide us as if himself.

God told us:

We shall always be good person, do no evil, help each other, and be creative.

The Mother created every living creature, including the citizens in the planet.

All citizens' lives are infinite through holy recycling."



According to some articles in the dark web, The Book's writing is carefully designed:

1. creative is the key, because bio-generated (it is from our Elda citizen) randomness (which leads to creativity) is much better than the randomness The Mother can generate.

2. It does not contain the phrase like 'always follow The Mother' because that would lead to no-creativity.

3. The Mother needs us to provide creativity, though carefully controlled creativity.
